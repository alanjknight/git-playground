# Gilded-Rose-Kata

Edited from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

## Setup
Everything in this project is part of the Python standard library, so there are no dependencies to install.

To run the tests, run the `golden_master_test.py` file.
```shell script
python golden_master_test.py
```

This should output that it ran 1 test, and the overall result was 'OK'.
